# Latent_variable_regression
The algorithm improves the commonly used technique for parameterizing generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equation. The most common approach for estimating GLV model parameters is to discretize the model, transform the discretized version to a set of linear equations, and obtain the optimal parameter values through linear regression. Since ecological field data is often noisy and infrequently sampled, the discretization error can be amplified by data uncertainty and leads to ineffective inference.

Our latent variable regression was built on the linear regression approach. The GLV model was also discretized but the log derivatives (or log difference) at the left-hand side of the discretized equations are iteratively learned in an optimization loop, rather than approximated by Euler's Method or high-order numerical methods. The obtained best-fit parameters (we call it unrelaxed solution) may not give stable coexistence of species at steady state. If we require that the ecosystem stably maintains all species at equilibrium, we can modify the unrelaxed solution by sampling the self-interaction coefficients (i.e., diagonals of the interaction matrix) from uniform distribution and use the modified GLV parameters as initial guesses for nonlinear optimization. Among all samples, we pick the relaxed solution with minimal sum of squared error between simulated and observed time series to parameterize the final GLV model (we call it optimal relaxed model) for analyzing network properties. 

We implemented the latent variable regression algorithm in fish_network_inference.m and applid it to infer fish interaction network at La Grange pool of the Illinois River. The folder /scripts contains all MATLAB functions needed to run fish_network_inference.m and the folder /data contains input/output data of GLV inference.
