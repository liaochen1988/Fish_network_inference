# Parameterizing generalized Lotka-Volterra model using latent gradient regression
The algorithm improves the commonly used technique for parameterizing generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equation. The most common approach for estimating gLV model parameters is to discretize the model, transform the discretized version to a set of linear equations, and obtain the optimal parameter values through linear regression. Since ecological field data is often noisy and infrequently sampled, the discretization error in the calculation of time derivatives of data can be amplified by the uncertainty associated with data itself and propogate forward. 

Our latent gradient regression optimized gradients of data as latent parameters in parallel to gLV coefficients. The optimization method was applied to infer fish interaction network at La Grange pool of the Illinois River. During the optimization, parameter sign constraints, obtained by reconstruction of a summary food web for the fish community using prior knowledge, were employed. MATLAB codes for network inference can be found in fish_network_inference.m. The folder /scripts contains all MATLAB functions needed to run fish_network_inference.m and the folder /data contains input data (time series and constraints).
